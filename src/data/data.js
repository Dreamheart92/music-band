        biography: [
            'Translated from Latvian SEVI means “Yourself” and if you dig deeper into the band’s lyrics, you will certainly find that the idea of being true to yourself, strongly embedded in their messages.',
            'SEVI were formed as the dream of two people to have a band.  Svetlana  Bliznakova – SEVI (singer and songwriter) and Rally Velinov (songwriter, bass player), who previously collaborated on a number of solo projects, established the band in January 2010. Although there were many changes in the crew during the years, the core of SEVI kept on following the initial path and ideas.',
            'The band started with original compositions from the beginning, not leaning on the well known cover songs formula. Against all odds, SEVI managed to catch the public’s attention right from the first single –“Can’t Stand the Pain”(June 2011). The band dreamed big and the video trailer of the song was the first music video trailer to be presented on cinema in Bulgaria. The song entered in the National Radio charts and also made it possible for SEVI to popularize their music outside of Europe.',
            'They were chosen for “Band Of The Week” in Rock Symphony Radio (Lima, Peru) and the single was presented on WSF Radio (Chicago), Mani Moore Radio (UK) etc. Driven by enthusiasm and desire, the band released their second single, “Limited Edition” on the same year. The catchy riffs and lyrics and the interesting appearance of the band in the video caught the attention of public and media. “Limited Edition“entered the radio charts right away! The song stayed for more than 46 weeks at TOP10 and 2 weeks at Number 3 position of the National Z-Rock Radio – “Kamenitza Rock 40 chart”',
            'In 2012 SEVI caught the attention with the brave idea to organize themselves a festival, dedicated to the new Bulgarian rock bands. They called it “23 & 1/2h Rock it Marathon.” The event took place at bar “Rock it” on 17th and 18th March the same year and had huge success and massive impact on the Bulgarian rock scene! 30 bands in 2 days played on the stage of “Rock it”. The festival had a second edition on the following year with a bigger line-up and larger list of styles.',
            'On June 14th 2012 SEVI released their debut studio album –“What Lies Beyond”. Inspired by the question “What Lies Beyond?”, the band presented the album dressed as pirates, who seek for new adventures and horizons and also decorated the stage as a pirate ship. That show put the beginning of a new approach in SEVI concerts. They wanted to be provocative and to give people a visual experience and show with all kinds of decorations and special effects. Right after the show, the band “sailed away” on a National Tour, presenting the album under the “pirate flag”. 2012 was a very successful year for SEVI. Not only they released a single, a debut album and managed to organize a second edition of their festival, but they released one of the strongest tracks in their future career. The song “Victim” was going to be a hit and the fan’s favorite track. It was released on November 30th (2012) with an amazing Acoustic Live that showed the soft side of the band and their creativity as musicians. The song topped the charts on Z-Rock Radio almost immediately and stayed at Top 10 for more than 12 weeks! SEVI continued the attack and right before the end of 2012 they presented a new trance project called “Shocked“, featuring Sugar DJ’s.',
            'On February 13th 2013 SEVI released their first acoustic album and a DVD called “The Other Side Of SEVI”. The video was filmed during the premiere of “Victim” and the acoustic set led the band to a number of concerts showing their softer side.',
            'In June 2013 with an extraordinary Route 66 show, SEVI presented the extreme video “Speed Up”, which was filmed on a truck, while moving around the city of Sofia during the opening of the motor season. Followed by the roar of Harley’s and free spirited bikers, the video is charged with passion, adrenaline, and the promise of boundless existence.',
            'The band started 2014 working on a new album and serious changes in the crew. Оn April 23th 2014, SEVI presented their 5th single and video—“On My Own”. Written by Svetlana Bliznakova and the Italian singer Pino Biaggioli in 2006, now fully arranged by SEVI, the song turned out to be one of the most ambitious projects of the band and one of the most loved songs by the fans.“On My Own” entered the top of the radio charts and stayed for couple of weeks on number one position at the National Z-Rock radio chart  – “Kamenitza Rock 40“! Summer of 2014 was very successful for SEVI. They were chosen to participate on Kavarna Rock Fest, where the international jury chose SEVI to open the night of Europe, Krokus, Gus G and Pretty Maids.',
            'In July started the first European tour for SEVI. They made concerts in Greece, Italy and Serbia. SEVI participated on the Italian festival Pirates of Rock and played at the main stage of the Serbian festival Gitarijada just before the great Serbian band Riblja Corba.
